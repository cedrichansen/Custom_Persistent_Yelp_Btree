# csc365hw02

Custom serializable Btree that stores Yelp Business Data files called "Nodes" and "Btree" (which have been excluded from this repo
due to size restrictions).

When the application starts to run, the program loads in the data to create clusters, which are generated based on lattitude
and longitude as a similarity score. From there, a GUI Launches, which displays a list of all businesses. A user may select
a business from the list, and press "find cluster" to display all of the elements which are in the same cluster as the selected
element. Additionally, the closest element is displayed at the bottom of the pane. A preview of the application is below.
